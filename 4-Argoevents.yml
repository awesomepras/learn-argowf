how to trigger ArgoWF from github

Create Github webhook
and then create the following in kubernetes
Event source(receives event from webhook and writes to event bus) -> Event Bus -> Sensor(listen to event from event bus & trigger the actions) -> trigger workflow template
https://argoproj.github.io/argo-events/eventsources/setup/github/

once Event source is created, it automatically creates a service and a pod. The name for the service is in {event-source-name}-eventsource-svc format
further create an ingress to access it from argo endpoint.

https://argoproj.github.io/argo-events/eventsources/naming/ This further explains how to create Event source correctly.

Finally, we can create a sensor file and define trigger conditions if any (https://argoproj.github.io/argo-events/sensors/trigger-conditions/).
